- 👋 Hi, I’m @Theo-xyz28
- 👀 I’m interested in programming language
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP Language in Schools
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on someone who is able to help each other
- 📫 visit my instagram @theofukeroo, you can DM me
- 😄 Pronouns: He/His/Boy
- ⚡ Fun fact: I first learned programming languages in 9th grade, funny enough I didn't do much consistently, and I learned by skipping the material, so I could figure out the general stuff without going into detail
